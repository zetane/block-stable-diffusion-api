# block-stable-diffusion-api
A block that generates images based on an input prompt using the Stability AI API.

This block can be used in ZetaForge, an open-source platform enabling developers to design, build, and deploy AI pipelines quickly. Check out ZetaForge on GitHub: https://github.com/zetane/zetaforge.

The Stable Diffusion API block takes in your [Stability AI](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/getting-started) API key and a prompt, generates an image based on your prompt, and returns the path to the generated image.
